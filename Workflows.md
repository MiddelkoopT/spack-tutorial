# Scientific Workflows

## Use Simple Solutions
Use simple solutions until they are not.

Python example.
1. System (package) interpreter and built in packages/modules.
2. Use venv
3. conda, anaconda, etc - skip this step
4. spack

Always stay in the project context (don't use user-space `pip install`)
